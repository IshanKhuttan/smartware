# Week 13

# Week 12

# Week 11
I worked on the Power up . First I had some problem finding the code online because the sensor I ordered was from Sparkfun programmed to  be run on Raspberry Pi 3b+ and all the code available online was of Adafruit and that was also Audrino driver. 

Intiallly I faced some problem getting the values from the sensor , but by the end of the lab I was able to get the readings from my sensor.

I tried With different metallic as well as electromagnetic devices . As soon as I got them close to the senosr the readings would change.

PROGRESS REPORT:- 
So it is week 10 and I got my PCB today from the prototype lab. I was late in getting it because when i went on monday to confirm that wheter my PCB is done but vlad told me that they havn't recieved any email under my name then I showed him the mail I had sent and he replied that it must be stuck in a spam or something like that and told me to re-send it again. So I got it on tuesday and did my soldering in the class.To connect my sensor to PCB I bought header pins for my sensor from the prototype lab. Once soldering was done so I tried to obtain my i2c address by connecting my PCB to the Raspberry and i was successful in doing it. 
So no additional expense was added in my original budget.
# Week 10
Got my pcb board and started working on soldering of it and made the use of necessary header pins as well as made sure that I can also get the same ip address once the sensor is soldered.

I Worked on soldering of the pcb and made sure the sensor is properly compatible with the pcb

# Week 9
Created pcb design, Breadboard as well as schema and exported generated Gerber file to Prototype lab.

THe File I sent for my PCB

# Week8
Worked on breadboarding and soldering. Tested my addrress on RPi and noticed my default address as 0x06. Later I realised it should suppose to show 0x0e. Worked on pinouts where I connected AD1 to +ve supply and AD0 to SCL and I was able to change my address from 0x05 to 0x0e.

**After** 
*When I changed my address*

Steps for pinout (Only for sensor that Iâ€™m currently holding):

1) Solder your sensor

2) Follow the RPI Header reference for your pinout to breadboard

3) Look for the 3V/5V pin from your Rpi and connect it to breadboard (pin no.1)

4) Connect VCC to 3V power supply and GND to common ground (pin no.5 in 2nd Row)

5) Now connect your SCL to I2C clock SCL pin on your RPi(pin no.3 in 2nd Row)

6) Connect SDA to I2C clock SDA pin on your RPI (which is pin no.2 in 2nd Row)
