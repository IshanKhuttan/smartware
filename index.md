# Week8
Worked on breadboarding and soldering. Tested my addrress on RPi and noticed my default address as 0x05. Later I realised it should suppose to show 0x06. Worked on pinouts where I connected AD1 to +ve supply and AD0 to SCL and I was able to change my address from 0x05 to 0x06

Steps for pinout (Only for sensor that Iâ€™m currently holding):

1) Solder your sensor

2) Follow the RPI Header reference for your pinout to breadboard

3) Look for the 3V/5V pin from your Rpi and connect it to breadboard (pin no.1)

4) Connect VCC to 3V power supply and GND to common ground (pin no.5 in 2nd Row)

5) Now connect your SCL to I2C clock SCL pin on your RPi(pin no.3 in 2nd Row)

6) Connect SDA to I2C clock SDA pin on your RPI (which is pin no.2 in 2nd Row)
